# ctf-tools

This is a collection of setup scripts to create an install of various security research tools.
Of course, this isn't a hard problem, but it's really nice to have them in one place that's easily deployable to new machines and so forth.
The install-scripts for these tools are checked every once in a while, so things should hopefully have a decent chance of working!

Installers for the following tools are included:

| Category | Tool | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|

## Usage

To use, do:

```bash
# set up the path
/path/to/ctf-tools/bin/manage-tools setup
source ~/.bashrc

# list the available tools
manage-tools list

# install gdb, allowing it to try to sudo install dependencies
manage-tools -s install gdb

# install pwntools, but don't let it sudo install dependencies
manage-tools install pwntools

# install qemu, but use "nice" to avoid degrading performance during compilation
manage-tools -n install qemu

# uninstall gdb
manage-tools uninstall gdb

# uninstall all tools
manage-tools uninstall all

# search for a tool
manage-tools search preload
```

Where possible, the tools keep the installs very self-contained (i.e., in to tool/ directory), and most uninstalls are just calls to `git clean` (**NOTE**, this is **NOT** careful; everything under the tool directory, including whatever you were working on, is blown away during an uninstall).

Python and Ruby tools are installed in a tool-specific virtual environment.
If you want to add other packages to this environment, look under the `ctf-tools/TOOL/pipx` or `ctf-tools/TOOL/gems` directories.

## Help!

Something not working?
I didn't write (almost) any of these tools, but hit up [the discord](https://discord.gg/KRcjyn4pBH) if you're desperate.
Maybe some kind soul will help!

## Dockerized Tools

### Prebuilt Tool Containers

You can get most of these tools in prebuilt containers from [https://hub.docker.com/r/ctftools](dockerhub).
For example:

```console
$ echo hi | docker run -i ctftools/taintgrind taintgrind --taint-stdin=yes /bin/cat
/home/ctf/tools/taintgrind/valgrind-3.21.0/build/bin/valgrind --tool=taintgrind --taint-stdin=yes /bin/cat
==8== Taintgrind, the taint analysis tool
==8== Copyright (C) 2010-2018, and GNU GPL'd, by Wei Ming Khoo.
==8== Using Valgrind-3.21.0 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info
==8== Command: /bin/cat
==8==
0xFFFFFFFF: _syscall_read | Read:3 | 0x0 | 4a5a000_unknownobj
hi
==8== 
```

### Building Your Own

You can build a docker image with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools
cd ctf-tools
docker build -t ctf-tools --build-arg PREINSTALLED=some-tool .
```

And run it with:

```bash
docker run -it ctf-tools
```

The built image will have ctf-tools cloned and ready to go and your tool installed.

## Kali Linux

Kali Linux (Sana and Rolling), due to manually setting certain libraries to not use the latest version available (sometimes being out of date by years) causes some tools to not install at all, or fail in strange ways.
Overriding these libraries breaks other tools included in Kali so your only solution is to either live with some of Kali's tools being broken, use docker, or running another distribution separately such as Ubuntu.

## Adding Tools

To add a tool (say, named *toolname*), do the following:

1. Create a `toolname` directory.
2. Create an `install` script.
3. Add it to the readme.
4. (optional) if special uninstall steps are required, create an `uninstall` script.

### Install Scripts

The install script will be run with `$PWD` being `toolname`. It should install the tool into this directory, in as contained a manner as possible.
Ideally, full uninstallation should be possible with a `git clean`.

The install script should create a `bin` directory and put its executables there.
These executables will be automatically linked into the main `bin` directory for the repo.
They could be launched from any directory, so don't make assumptions about the location of `$0`!

## License

The individual tools are all licensed under their own licenses.
As for ctf-tools itself, it is licensed under BSD 2-Clause License.
If you find it useful, star it on github (https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools).

Good luck!

## Useful CTF tools in docker images

Previously, this repository included some scripts that were wrappers around `docker pull`.
We trust that you can do that yourself :-)

## Useful CTF Libraries

Previously, this repository included library installers.
Because of how bespoke library install preferences are (e.g., unlike a tool, it's not clear if per-library venvs are a desired thing), we've stopped shipping them, and link them here for posterity.
